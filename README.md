# PFDA
#### PFDA repository includes my_work, assignments, and project that focus on the acquired knowledge and skills in the PROGRAMMING FOR DATA ANALYTICS course at ATU, lecturer Andrew Beatty (https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware.git)

## Purpose of PFDA: 
#### 1)Programmatically create plots and other visual outputs from data.
#### 2)Design computer algorithms to solve numerical problems.
#### 3)Create software that incorporates and utilizes standard numerical libraries.
#### 4)Employ appropriate data structures when programming for data-intensive applications.

# Assignment 2 weather
#### Jupyter notebook called assignment2-weather.ipynb that has a nice plot of the temperature over time( "dryBulbTemperature_Celsius" ). 

# Assignment 3 domains
#### A notebook called assignment03-pie.ipynb has a nice pie chart of people's email domains in the csv file at the URL https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download. This CSV file has 1000 people. You may download the data or link to it.

# Assignment 5
#### Notebook called assignment_5_risk.ipynb simulates 1000 individual battle rounds in Risk (3 attackers vs 2 defenders) and plots the result. One battle round is one shake of the attacker and defender dice.
#### Rules of Risk: In Risk one army fights another. (using 6 sided dice). In each battle round, the attacker can put forward up to three of their troops (3 dice). The defender can use up to two of their defending troops (2 dice). Each side loses troops depending on the following rules: The two top dice are compared (ie the attacker's top dice roll with the defender's top dice roll). If the attacker's dice are the same or lower they lose one troop otherwise the defender loses a troop (ie if the attacker's dice are higher). The next two highest dice from each side are then compared (ie the attacker's second-highest to the defender's second-highest). If the attacker dice are the same or lower they lose one troop otherwise the defender loses a troop (ie if the attacker dice is higher)

# Assignment 6 (Knock airport Weather)
#### Create a python file or notebook called assignment_6_Weather (.py or .ipynb). Get the data from this link: https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv. Create Plots: 1)The temperature 2) the mean temperature each day. 3) mean temperature for each month 4) Windspeed (data is missing from this column) 5) rolling windspeed (say over 24 hours) 6) max windspeed for each day 7) monthly mean of the daily max windspeeds

## Description of project:
#### Notebook project_pfda demonstrates performing data analysis on data on wind speed around the country to windfarm from https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data website.

## Description of data set:
#### Station Name: SHANNON AIRPORT, Station Height: 15 M, Latitude:52.690, Longitude: -8.918, date:-00 to 00 UTC, rain:- Precipitation Amount(mm), maxtp:-Maximum Air Temperature(C), mintp:-Minimum  Air Temperature(C), gmin:-09utc Grass Minimum Temperature(C), soil:-Mean 10cm Soil Temperature(C),wdsp:-Mean Wind Speed (knot), hm:- Highest 10 minute mean wind speed (knot), ddhm:-Wind Direction at max 10 min. mean (deg), hg:-Highest Gust (knot), cbl:-Mean CBL Pressure (hpa), sun:-Sunshine duration (hours), pe:-Potential Evapotranspiration (mm), evap:-Evaporation (mm), smd_wd:-Soil Moisture Deficits(mm) well drained, smd_md:-Soil Moisture Deficits(mm) moderately drained, smd_pd:-Soil Moisture Deficits(mm) poorly drained, ind:-Indicator(i).

## Steps: 
#### 1) create project folder with project_pfda.ipynb file. 2)Download a CSV file with mean wind speed from Shannon Airport location from 01 January 1990. 3) Clean and normalize the data. 4) Make analysis 5)Cleaning, Regression, and Interpolation Data Comparison 6)Synthesis 7) Ploting 8)Conclusions
