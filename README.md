# PFDA
#### PFDA repository includes my_work, assignments and project that focus on the acquired knowledge and skills in PROGRAMMING FOR DATA ANALYTICS course at ATU, lecturer Andrew Beatty.

# Assignment 2 weather
#### Jupyter notebook called assignment2-weather.ipynb that has a nice plot of the temperature over time( "dryBulbTemperature_Celsius" ). 

# Assignment 3 domains
#### Notebook called assignment03-pie.ipynb have a nice pie chart of peoples email domains in the csv file at the url https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download. This csv file has 1000 people. You may download the data or link to it.

# Assignment 5
#### Notebook called assignment_5_risk.ipynb simulates 1000 individual battle rounds in Risk (3 attacker vs 2 defender) and plots the result. One battle round is one shake of the attacker and defender dice.
#### Rules of Risk: In Risk one army fights another. (using 6 sided dice). In each battle round, the attacker can put forward up to three of their troops (3 dice).The defender can use up to two of their defending troops (2 dice).Each side looses troops depending on the following rules:The two top dice dice are compared (ie the attackers top dice roll with the defenders top dice roll).If the attackers dice is the same or lower they loose one troop otherwise the defender looses a troop (ie if the attackers dice is higher). The next two highest dice from each side are then compared (ie the attackers second highest to the defenders second highest). If the attackers dice is the same or lower they loose one troop otherwise the defender looses a troop (ie if the attackers dice is higher)

# Assignment 6 (Knock airport Weather)
#### Create a python file or notebook called assignment_6_Weather (.py or .ipynb). Get the data from this link: https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv. Create Plots:1)The temperature, 2) mean temperature each day. 3) mean temperature for each month, 4)Windspeed (there is data missing from this column),5) rolling windspeed (say over 24 hours),6) max windspeed for each day,7) monthly mean of the daily max windspeeds
